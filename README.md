# Contentrain Shared Models

This repository is a hub for sharing and reusing JSON Schemas and corresponding content examples, with a primary focus on common data structures used in app development projects, such as `Products`, `Posts`, and more. The goal is to eliminate the need for developers to repeatedly create these schemas from scratch, allowing them to easily discover, reuse, and contribute to existing schemas.

## Why Contribute?

- **Efficiency:** Save time and effort by reusing schemas tailored for common web development data models.
  
- **Collaboration:** Contribute your own schemas and benefit from a collaborative space where developers can learn, share, and enhance their data structures.

- **Inspiration:** Find inspiration in the schemas shared by others and leverage existing structures for your projects.

## How to Contribute?

1. **Add a Schema:** To contribute, simply add your JSON Schema to the `schemas` folder. Include a readme file to provide context and usage instructions.

2. **Share Your Use Cases:** Describe how your schema can be applied, and share any specific use cases or scenarios where it proves beneficial.

3. **Collaborate:** Engage with other contributors, provide feedback, and discuss best practices for various data models.

## How to Use?

1. **Explore and Discover:** Explore the `schemas` folder to discover pre-built schemas for common data models used in web projects.

2. **Quick Integration:** Easily integrate the schemas into your Contentrain projects or any other web development projects.

3. **Customization:** Tailor the schemas to your specific needs or contribute enhancements to make them more versatile.
